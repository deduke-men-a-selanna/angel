The English letters and their (approximate) pronunciation
-

Some details (especially concerning rare pronunciations) have been **omitted**.

Consonants and consonant combinations systematically grouped
-

✍️ Double consonants (like e.g. `tt`) are **not** pronounced longer than single consonants in English.

The pronunciation of the following consonants and consonant combinations is (approximately) **identical** in English and Portuguese.

    b      always like                 b   in   bola

    nk     always like                 nc  in   branco

The pronunciation of the following consonants and consonant combinations is **different** in English and Portuguese. **However, the Portuguese pronunciation should still be somewhat understandable in English**.

    j      always like                             d + j in joelho
    ch     always like                             t + ch in chão
    g      in front of e, i, y often (!) like      d + g in geral, girafa
           else always like                        g   in   gato

The pronunciation of the following consonants and consonant combinations **needs to be learned**.

    ph     always like             f   in   ferro
    gh     mostly not pronounced
           rarely like             f   in   ferro

    w      always like             u   in   Kauã
    wh     always like             u   in   Kauã

    sh     always like             x   in   caixa
    ti     in Latin words like     x   in   caixa

    th     ☞ see remarks below

    ck     always like             c   in   casa

The sound of `th` is not very predictable. It can always either be [☞ voiceless (e.g. in "tha atha")](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Voiceless_dental_fricative.ogg) or [☞ voiced (e.g. in "tha atha")](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6a/Voiced_dental_fricative.ogg). However, I would estimate that the sound of `th` is in **most cases** [☞ voiceless (e.g. in "tha atha")](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Voiceless_dental_fricative.ogg).

Before any vowel that sounds like `ou` in `you`, a `y`-sound needs to be inserted, so:

    pure            sounds as if it was written        pyoure
    beautiful       sounds as if it was written        byoutiful
    tube            sounds as if it was written        tyoube
    during          sounds as if it was written        dyouring
    cute            sounds as if it was written        cyoute
    argue           sounds as if it was written        argyou
    music           sounds as if it was written        myousic
    spew            sounds as if it was written        spyou
    student         sounds as if it was written        styoudent

Stressed syllables
-

As a **rule of thumb**, mostly the **first** syllable is stressed. Mistakes are **not** problematic. People should still be able to understand you.


Reading exercise: Example text from the Bible (the beginning of the book of Exodus) with "irregularly" stressed syllables being marked
-

These are the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt with Jacob, each with his family: Reuben, Simeon, Levi and Judah; Issachar, Zebulun and Benjamin; Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher. The de`scen`dants of Jacob numbered seventy in all; Joseph was al`rea`dy in Egypt.

Now Joseph and all his brothers and all that gene`ra`tion died, but the Israelites were ex`cee`dingly fruitful; they multiplied greatly, in`creased` in numbers and be`came` so numerous that the land was filled with them.

Then a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt. “Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous for us. Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will be`come` even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight a`gainst` us and leave the country.”

So they put slave masters over them to op`press` them with forced labor, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. But the more they were op`pressed`, the more they multiplied and spread; so the E`gyp`tians came to dread the Israelites and worked them ruthlessly. They made their lives bitter with harsh labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their harsh labor the E`gyp`tians worked them ruthlessly.

The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, “When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the de`li`very stool, if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.” The midwives, how`e`ver, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live. Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?”

The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like E`gyp`tian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives ar`rive`.”

So God was kind to the midwives and the people in`creased` and became even more numerous. And be`cause` the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.

Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.”
