1. Use a vocabulary learning app. I recommend using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).
2. Use a good vocabulary card deck for Anki. I recommend downloading and using [A Frequency Dictionary of German_.apkg](https://github.com/deduke-men-a-selanna/angel/raw/5629636d776de47d70176af865f462fc5a0685b1/A%20Frequency%20Dictionary%20of%20German_.apkg). This file is located in this repository.
* The direction of learning is German -> English. This can be changed, if necessary.
* This deck is a slightly changed variant of [this deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/912352287).
* The following changes have been made:
    * 7 words have been suspended, as they are too confusing in the beginning to learn as vocabulary. These words are
        * der "the; that, those; who, that"
        * sein "to be; (past tense)"
        * ein "a, an; one (of)"
        * haben "to have; (past tense)"
        * sie "she, her; they, them; you"
        * werden "to become, get; (future tense); (passive voice)"
        * ihr "you, her; her, their, hers, theirs; your".
    * On the answer side of every card there is now additionally the corresponding [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) entry to every word. There you can find additional information that the cards otherwise lack.
