How to learn German vocabulary effectively?
-

Use a vocabulary learning app.
-

I recommend using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

Use a good vocabulary card deck for Anki.
-

I recommend downloading and importing `one` of the following decks:

* [A Frequency Dictionary of German - German to English.apkg](https://github.com/deduke-men-a-selanna/angel/raw/main/A%20Frequency%20Dictionary%20of%20German%20-%20German%20to%20English.apkg).
* [A Frequency Dictionary of German - English to German.apkg](https://github.com/deduke-men-a-selanna/angel/raw/main/A%20Frequency%20Dictionary%20of%20German%20-%20English%20to%20German.apkg).

These files are located in [this repository here](https://github.com/deduke-men-a-selanna/angel).

Unfortunately, as these decks are identical with the only difference that their vocabulary cards are mirrored, due to how Anki manages decks, these decks cannot coexist with each other within the Anki app. Therefore, you need to choose `one` of these decks.

These decks are slightly changed variants of [this deck](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/912352287). The following changes have been made:

* 7 words have been suspended and cannot be learned, unless they get unsuspended, as they are too confusing in the beginning to learn as vocabulary. These words are
    * `der` "the; that, those; who, that"
    * `sein` "to be; (past tense)"
    * `ein` "a, an; one (of)"
    * `haben` "to have; (past tense)"
    * `sie` "she, her; they, them; you"
    * `werden` "to become, get; (future tense); (passive voice)"
    * `ihr` "you, her; her, their, hers, theirs; your".
* On the answer side of every card there is now additionally the corresponding [Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Main_Page) entry to every German word. There you can find additional information that the cards otherwise lack.

For every noun, learn the grammatical gender, the genitive singular and the nominative plural.
-

This is important, because this information will tell you how to use the nouns properly:

* `Nouns of class s1`: If the **genitive singular** of a noun **ends in -s or -es**, then **all other singular cases** have **no ending and are therefore identical to the nominative singular**. However, sometimes the dative singular **can optionally** end in -e.
* `Nouns of class s2a`: If the **genitive singular** of a noun **ends in -en**, then **the dative and accusative singular end in -en**, as well.
* `Nouns of class s2b`: If the **genitive singular** of a **neuter** noun **ends in -en**, then **only dative singular ends in -en**, as well. The **accusative singular**, however, **is identical to the nominative singular**.
* `Nouns of class s3`: If the **genitive singular** of a noun **is identical to the nominative singular**, then **all other singular cases are identical to the nominative singular**, as well.

Some examples for the `singular cases`:

    noun class         | s1        | s1       | s2a           | s2b             | s3
    word               | der Vater | das Kind | der Mensch    | das Junge       | die Mutter
    grammatical gender | masculine | neuter   | masculine     | neuter          | feminine
    "the ..."          | "father"  | "child"  | "human being" | "young (thing)" | "mother"
    ___________________|___________|__________|_______________|_________________|_____________
    nominative         | Vater     | Kind     | Mensch        | Junge           | Mutter
    genitive           | Vaters    | Kindes   | Menschen      | Jungen          | Mutter
    dative             | Vater     | Kind(e)  | Menschen      | Jungen          | Mutter
    accusative         | Vater     | Kind     | Menschen      | Junge           | Mutter

* `Nouns of class p1`: If the **nominative plural** of a noun **ends in -e, -el, or -er**, then **the dative plural adds a -n** and **all other plural cases are identical to the nominative plural**.
* `Nouns of class p2`: If the **nominative plural** of a noun **ends in any other way**, then **all other plural cases are identical to the nominative plural**.

Some examples for the `plural cases`:

    noun class         | p1         | p1            | p1         | p2        | p2
    word               | Tische     | Schlüssel     | Männer     | Bären     | Autos
                       | "tables"   | "keys"        | "men"      | "bears"   | "cars"
    ___________________|____________|_______________|____________|___________|____________
    nominative         | Tische     | Schlüssel     | Männer     | Bären     | Autos
    genitive           | Tische     | Schlüssel     | Männer     | Bären     | Autos
    dative             | Tischen    | Schlüsseln    | Männern    | Bären     | Autos
    accusative         | Tische     | Schlüssel     | Männer     | Bären     | Autos

Therefore, you need to learn, for example:

    der Vater      Vaters     Väter
    das Kind       Kindes     Kinder
    der Mensch     Menschen   Menschen
    das Junge      Jungen     Jungen
    die Mutter     Mutter     Mütter
    der Tisch      Tisches    Tische
    der Schlüssel  Schlüssels Schlüssel
    der Mann       Mannes     Männer
    der Bär        Bären      Bären
    das Auto       Autos      Autos

`Explanation`: The article (`der`, `die`, `das`) shows the grammatical gender (masculine, feminine, neuter). The first form is the nominative singular, the second form is the genitive singular, the third form is the nominative plural.

Having learned the previous examples, we can deduce the noun classes of these nouns:

    der Vater      s1          p1
    das Kind       s1          p1
    der Mensch     s2a         p2
    das Junge      s2b         p2
    die Mutter     s3          p1
    der Tisch      s1          p1
    der Schlüssel  s1          p1
    der Mann       s1          p1
    der Bär        s2a         p2
    das Auto       s1          p2

`Exceptions to the rules given above`: The nouns `Herz` "heart", `Name` "name", `Buchstabe` "letter", `Funke` "spark", `Gedanke` "thought", and `Wille` "will". Also, there are some more subtleties mostly connected with the use of names of persons which cannot be treated here.

For every verb, there are 6 forms that need to be learned
-

These forms are:

* the infinitive ("to do")
* the 3rd person singular present indicative ("he does")
* the 3rd person singular preterite indicative ("he did")
* the 3rd person singular preterite subjunctive ("he would do")
* the 2nd person singular imperative ("Do!")
* the past participle together with its auxiliary ("to have done")

If you know these 6 forms of a verb, then you can derive `all` other forms from them.
Unfortunately, it can't be shown here how this works, as this would go to far for now.

Regularly, these 6 forms look like this (the examples are `fragen` "to ask" and `ordnen` "to organize"):

    fragen      fragt       fragte      fragte      frag        gefragt haben
    ordnen      ordnet      ordnete     ordnete     ordne       geordnet haben

From this, we can deduct the following `rules for regular verbs`:

    * the INFINITIVE needs to be learned
    * the 3rd person singular present indicative      = INFINITIVE - en + (e)t
    * the 3rd person singular preterite indicative    = INFINITIVE - en + (e)te
    * the 3rd person singular preterite subjunctive   = INFINITIVE - en + (e)te
    * the 2nd person singular imperative              = INFINITIVE - en + (e)
    * the past participle together with its auxiliary = ge + INFINITIVE - en + (e)t + haben

Irregularly, these 6 forms might look like this, for example:

    sehen       sieht       sah         sähe        sieh        gesehen haben

As a consequence, in the case of the verb `sehen` "to see", all forms need to be learned, as they are all irregular.

`Two` Anki decks with German irregular verbs are available here:

* [German to English](https://github.com/deduke-men-a-selanna/angel/raw/main/German%20Irregular%20Verbs%20-%20German%20to%20English.apkg)
* [English to German](https://github.com/deduke-men-a-selanna/angel/raw/main/German%20Irregular%20Verbs%20-%20English%20to%20German.apkg)

These files are located in in [this repository here](https://github.com/deduke-men-a-selanna/angel).

This time, `both` decks can be used in Anki simultaneously!

These decks were created based on a list of German irregular verbs that can be found [here](https://jakubmarian.com/list-of-irregular-strong-german-verbs/).

For every preposition, learn the cases that can be combined with it, as well as the meanings of those combinations.
