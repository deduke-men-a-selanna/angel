The naturalization test
-

The test consists of 33 questions, 3 of which are state-related questions that only have to be answered for the federal state of Germany in which you live. For each question you have to choose the right answer from four possible answers. If you answer at least 17 questions correctly, you have passed the test. In recent years, well over 90% of participants have passed the test.

All questions are formulated in German. For every question, 4 answers are given, but only 1 is correct. You will have 60 minutes to take the test.

The test will look like [☞ this](https://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Integration/Einbuergerung/musterbogen_einbuergerungstest.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=8).

The 33 questions are chosen from a catalogue of 460 questions. This catalogue (**without solutions!**) can be found [☞ here](https://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Integration/Einbuergerung/gesamtfragenkatalog-lebenindeutschland.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=10).
