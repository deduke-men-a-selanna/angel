Requirements for German Citizenship by Marriage
-

* ...

Your residence records are in the government system, so this will be an easy requirement to fulfil.

* You must prove German language proficiency of at least B1.

You can prove that you know German up to the B1 level required by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, by providing any of these documents:

    * A German language certificate such as the Zertifikat Deutsch.
    * A certification that you have obtained through an integration course, such as the “DTZ – German test for immigrants.”
    * If you do not have any document, which proves your language proficiency, you can complete a government language test administered by your citizenship authority.

* You must be financially able to support yourself and your family without any help from the state.

For financial stability, you can submit bank statements and other documents, which state your financial situation.

* You must be a law-abiding citizen with no criminal record.

* You must pass a citizenship test.

This test includes 33 multiple choice questions on German living, society, rules, and laws, as well as questions specific to the place you live. The test takes one hour, and you must answer at least 17 questions correctly to pass the test. When you pass the test, you will get a naturalization certificate, which you can add to your document file.

To prepare for the test, you can take an integration course, use the practice test options of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees, or simply read more information on German life and laws.

* You must renounce any previous citizenships.

You must give up all previous citizenships, except if the other country does not allow it or it is impossible to give it up. This impossibility is the case with many countries involved in conflicts, such as Syria.
