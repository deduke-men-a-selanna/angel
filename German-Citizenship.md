Requirements for German citizenship by naturalization
-

The person ...
* ... **has lived permanently and lawfully in Germany** for eight years:
    * You have been legally resident in Germany for at least 8 years. The period is shortened to 7 years by successful participation in an integration course. **If you have a German spouse or life partner, a stay ("Aufenthalt") of at least 3 years is sufficient.**
        * By marrying, your foreign spouse does not automatically acquire German citizenship. **In general, if you have been married for at least two years, your spouse has a right to naturalization after three years of lawful residence ("rechtmäßiger Aufenthalt") in the Federal Republic of Germany under certain additional conditions.**
* ... has unlimited or permanent right of residence at the time of naturalization:
    * **You have an unlimited right of residence ("unbefristetes Aufenthaltsrecht") or a specific residence permit ("bestimmter Aufenthaltstitel").** A temporary residence permit ("befristete Aufenthalttserlaubnis") is only partially sufficient if it could lead to permanent residence in Germany, e.g. the EU Blue Card. A residence permit ("Aufenthaltsgestattung") or a temporary deportation ("Duldung") does not meet the requirements.
* ... **has clarified identity and nationality.**
* ... **has commitment to the free democratic basic order of the Basic Law**.
* ... is in principle giving up the previous nationality:
    * They are willing to give up their previous citizenship. If you are a citizen of a member state of the EU or certain other countries, you can keep your previous citizenship.
        * **According to [this inofficial German source](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diskussion:Brasilianische_Staatsb%C3%BCrgerschaft), Brazilians normally keep their previous citizenship**.
* ... **has oral and written German language skills at level B1** of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. In order to prove your German language skills, **you need to take a [☞ test](https://github.com/deduke-men-a-selanna/angel/blob/main/German-Citizenship.md#the-german-language-test)**.
* ... has proof of knowledge of the legal and social system and living conditions in Germany (i.e. **has passed the [☞ naturalization test](https://github.com/deduke-men-a-selanna/angel/blob/main/German-Citizenship.md#the-naturalization-test)**).
* ... is capable of securing the livelihood for themselves and their dependents **independently of the German state**:
    * You can support yourself and your dependent family members **without claiming social assistance or unemployment benefit II (“Hartz IV”)**. Anyone who receives social assistance or unemployment benefit II through no fault of their own can still be naturalized.
* ... can guarantee their integration into German living conditions, in particular is not married with several spouses at the same time.
* ... has no criminal conviction:
    * **You have not been convicted of a criminal offense (in Germany???).**

The naturalization test
-

The test consists of 33 questions, 3 of which are state-related questions that only have to be answered for the federal state of Germany in which you live. For each question you have to choose the right answer from four possible answers. **If you answer at least 17 questions correctly, you have passed the test.** In recent years, well over 90% of participants have passed the test.

**All questions are formulated in German. For every question, 4 answers are given, but only 1 is correct. You will have 60 minutes to take the test.**

The test will look like [☞ this](https://www.bamf.de/SharedDocs/Anlagen/DE/Integration/Einbuergerung/musterbogen_einbuergerungstest.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=8).

The 33 questions are chosen from a catalogue of 460 questions. **Gladly, there is an [☞ Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) deck that covers all 460 questions and that can be downloaded [☞ here](https://github.com/deduke-men-a-selanna/angel/raw/main/Einbrgerungstest_Deutschland_alle_Bundeslnder.apkg).** This file is located in this repository [☞ here](https://github.com/deduke-men-a-selanna/angel).
